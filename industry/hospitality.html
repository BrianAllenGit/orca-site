description: Individually, hospitality businesses do not have a significant negative impact on the environment. Collectively however, they can be very wasteful and consume a huge amount of resources. It has been estimated that excessive consumption in hotels, for example, can account for up to 75% of the hotel’s environmental impacts and create unnecessary operational costs. In recent years, many hospitality operators have employed a variety of initiatives in an effort to reduce both their cost of doing business and the impact that they are having on the environment. But there’s always the opportunity to do more. Take energy, for example. Excessive energy use is extremely costly and significant cost reductions can be achieved via the introduction of variety of power saving technologies. With a Forum Enviro Energy Optimisation Plan, not only do we develop a uniquely tailored solution for your business, we guarantee the savings we will deliver. Waste management is also a key issue. Many businesses are extremely effective at reducing waste through reuse and recycling, but the fact remains that a large proportion of their waste still ends up in landfill and is extremely costly to dispose. Solutions for waste minimisation, such as the upcoming Forum WasteMaster, are key to finding new and innovative answers to this growing problem. You might think you’ve done everything you can to reduce your environmental impact – why not see what else we can do for you?
