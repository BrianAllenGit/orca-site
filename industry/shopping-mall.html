description: <p>Most shopping malls have food service tenants that generate a large amount of food waste. This is a major problem the ORCA technology can solve.</p><p>For those food service tenants, the ORCA will be seen as an extended service that helps them eliminate food waste.</p><p>And for the mall, it’s a great way to achieve green/waste disposal diversion goals, with significant cost savings.</p><p>As well, with fewer trucks coming and going to pick up food waste, the mall’s loading docks will be freed up for other vehicles, resulting in more efficient deliveries.</p>
