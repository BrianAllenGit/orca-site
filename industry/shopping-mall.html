subheader: Shopping Mall Management Solution 
description: Most shopping malls have food service tenants that generate a large amount of food waste. This is a major problem the ORCA technology can solve. For those food service tenants, the ORCA will be seen as an extended service that helps them eliminate food waste. And for the mall, it’s a great way to achieve green/waste disposal diversion goals, with significant cost savings. As well, with fewer trucks coming and going to pick up food waste, the mall’s loading docks will be freed up for other vehicles, resulting in more efficient deliveries.
