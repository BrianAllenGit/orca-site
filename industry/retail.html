description: Longer opening hours, increasing customer choice, reduced margins. Retailers are looking at all elements of their business to reduce their operational costs. Too often the trade off for managing the increasing cost of doing business is reduced staff numbers, lack of innovation and poorer customer service. More and more businesses are feeling the impacts of rising energy and fuel costs, as they impact their ability to re-invest much needed cash into their business to stay ahead of the competition.
