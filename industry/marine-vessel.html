description:  <p>The ORCA can go to sea—it’s been installed on marine vessels such as cruise ships, which have hundreds of passengers on board generating large volumes of food waste.</p><p>With limited space on board for the storage of food waste disposal solution, the ORCA technology has cut down on foul odors and pest problems. Kitchen staff on marine vessels simply feed food waste to the ORCA, and it’s processed within 24 hours and turned into harmless water. Plus, the ORCA is fully compliant with the IMO’s MARPOL revised Annex V.</p><p>And, by eliminating food waste on board, the cost of removing it once the ship arrives at port is reduced.</p>
