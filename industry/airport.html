subheader: Airport Waste Management Solution
description: <p>With security being a prime consideration at all airports, having an ORCA on site eliminates the risk from trucks arriving and departing from the loading docks to haul away food waste to landfill. Fewer trucks entering the restricted airport zone helps create a safer environment for airport workers and passengers.</p><p>The ORCA technology can be located on site at the airport, eating food waste and transforming it into water that flows straight into the municipal sewage system. So there is absolutely no security risk.</p><p>By eliminating the cost of waste disposal trucks, airports can benefit from cost savings, as well as a reduction in foul odors and pest problems associated with stored food waste.</p><p>Plus, an airport with an ORCA is more sustainable and environmentally friendly, and perceived more positively in the public eye.</p>
