title:  EcoWaste Digester - FAQs
description: <h5><strong>How often and how much can I feed the EcoWaste Digester?</strong></h5><p>This will be dependent on the type of food waste you put in it. But as a general rule it is advised you try and feed every 2 to 3 hours. The higher the frequency of feeding, the greater yield of digestion over a 24-hour period.</p><p>Feeding the EcoWaste Digester will also depend on the type of food waste and the size of your EcoWaste Digester system.</p>The general guidelines are&#58;<ul><li>OG25&#58; processes 25 lbs per hour.</li><li>OG50&#58; processes 50 lbs per hour.</li><li>OG100&#58; processes 100 lbs per hour.</li></ul><h5><strong>When do I know the EcoWaste Digester is at capacity?</strong></h5><p>To avoid overfilling, ensure that you can always see the rubber top of the auger arm. In the event of overfilling, the water sensors that are located on each side of the EcoWaste Digester will be blocked and it will not operate effectively. Do not overfill the EcoWaste Digester.</p><h5><strong>Do I need to refill the Microorganisms?</strong></h5><p>No, the Microorganism reservoir is locked and only accessible by the EcoWaste Digester Service Department. If the red microbe sensor light goes on please contact EcoWaste Digester service support at 1-855-355-6722 (EcoWaste Digester) to schedule refill service. Please note this light will go on when the levels are getting low but you will still have one week’s worth of Microorganisms.</p><h5><strong>How often do the Bio Chips need to be replaced</strong></h5><p>Our service department will inspect the Bio Chips at each monthly service visit and will replace them as necessary.</p><h5><strong>What should I do if the red lights come on?</strong></h5><p>If the microbe light sensor comes on, please contact EcoWaste Digester service support at 1-855-355-6722(EcoWaste Digester). Keep in mind that you will still have at least one week’s worth of Microorganisms in reserve.</p>If the water light sensor comes on and is solid, spray down sensors with the hose attached to the machine and/or remove extra food waste from the EcoWaste Digester.</p><p>If there is any standing water present in the EcoWaste Digester please contact service support at1-855-355-6722 (EcoWaste Digester).</p><h5><strong>Should I ever turn the machine off?</strong></h5><p>No, the EcoWaste Digester should never be turned off and should be running continuously. Only in the event of an emergency should the EcoWaste Digester ever be turned off. Please note that the EcoWaste Digester will go into power save mode if the door has not been opened for 12hours.</p><h5><strong>How much water does the EcoWaste Digester use?</strong></h5><ul><li>OG25&#58; 100 gallons */ 24 hr</li><li>OG50&#58; 150 gallons */ 24 hrs</li><li>OG100&#58; 200 gallons */ 24 hrs</li><li>* at peak capacity averages</li></ul><h5><strong>How much electricity does the EcoWaste Digester use?</strong></h5><ul><li>OG25 (OG600)&#58; 16 kw */ 24 hrs</li><li>OG50 (OG1200)&#58; 16 kw */ 24 hrs</li><li>OG100 (OG2400)&#58; 28 kw* / 24 hr</li><li>* at peak capacity averages</li></ul><h5><strong>What happens if I find contamination in the EcoWaste Digester?</h5></strong><p>Try to avoid contaminants going into the EcoWaste Digester as they will not decompose and will lead to odor issues, as well as potentially harming operations. Please take extra care to monitor all food waste prior to placing in the EcoWaste Digester, ensuring that it is free of contaminants. Any time you see contamination within the EcoWaste Digester please REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY.</p><h5><strong>Is there any residue left over?</strong></h5><p>As long as organic material is being placed in the EcoWaste Digester there will not be any residue left over. Keep in mind that some items will take longer to be digested. For example, lettuce and peelings will digest much quicker than chicken bones. The Microorganisms will keep digesting the organic waste until it is in the form of a ‘grey wastewater’ which then goes through the screen at the bottom of the EcoWaste Digester into the sanitary drain.</p><h5><strong>How fast will you respond when there is a problem?</strong></h5><p>EcoWaste Digester’s Service Department will make the very best effort to respond to any service calls the same day or guaranteed the next day.</p><h5><strong>How is the organic waste broken down?</strong></h5><p>In the EcoWaste Digester, organic waste is degraded using aerobic digestion, the process by which Microorganisms use oxygen to break down organic matter into water and carbon dioxide.</p><h5><strong>Does the process work?</strong></h5><p>Yes. Our technology employs aerobic digestion using a naturally occurring Microorganism inside a moving bed biofilm reactor. By balancing the environment inside the reactor, the process is able to break down solid organics into wastewater, on average within 24 hours.</p><h5><strong>Do Microorganisms affect the safety of our work environment?</strong></h5><p>The Microorganisms used in the EcoWaste Digester are a particular strand which is naturally present in the environment. As with any waste product, you should take normal precautions while handling EcoWaste Digester food waste or effluent, but it does not pose a danger to the air, the water, or to employees who work with the EcoWaste Digester system.</p><h5><strong>What kind of training is included?</strong></h5><p>Once the EcoWaste Digester is installed, your dedicated Account Manager will conduct training sessions for all staff members to ensure proper technology and program adoption across the organization. EcoWaste Digester will also provide training materials (video, manual, etc.) for new hires and ongoing training.</p><h5><strong>What are some alternatives to EcoWaste Digester?</strong></h5><p>While traditional waste hauling and composting remain the most common waste solutions available, both face great environmental sustainability challenges. Legislation is also making it difficult for either to solve those challenges.</p><h5><strong>What types of businesses can benefit from EcoWaste Digester?</strong></h5><p>EcoWaste Digester is designed to handle and digest high volumes of food waste. For that reason, businesses such as supermarkets, hotels, convention centers, stadiums, shopping malls, hospitals, prisons etc. would benefit most from the EcoWaste Digester solution.</p><h5><strong>What happens to the effluent when it leaves the machine?</strong></h5><p>Once the effluent is discharged from the machine, it is disposed of directly into the internal drainage system where it then flows into the public sewage system. From here, it will be treated at the wastewater treatment plant and discharged into rivers, lakes or other sources as clean water.</p><h5><strong>How long is the installation process?</strong></h5><p>Once pre-installation requirements are confirmed, installation can be completed in one day.</p>
