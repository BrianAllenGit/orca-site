title: ORCA EcoWaste Digester - How It Works
description: <p>The ORCA EcoWaste Digester is a machine that “digests” up to 2,400 pounds (over 1 ton) of food waste per day. Within 24 hours, this technology turns food waste into environmentally safe water that flows straight into the municipal sewage system.</p><p>The sustainable technology is housed in a stainless steel container, with a door on the top which employees open to throw food waste inside. Within the container, the ORCA EcoWaste Digester’s proprietary, natural Microorganism solution works with water and recycled plastic Bio Chips to quickly break down the waste. Through a process called “aerobic digestion,” the ORCA EcoWaste Digester technology constantly churns all this material, adding oxygen that accelerates the time it takes to transform the food waste disposal into earth-friendly water.</p>
