description: <p>Office buildings are prime locations for EcoWaste Digester technology. Cafeterias and other food service facilities in office buildings can install an EcoWaste Digester and eliminate the cost of having trucks haul away food waste to landfill.</p><p>The EcoWaste Digester helps boost security, with fewer trucks arriving and departing at the loading docks, and it increases the perception of having a cleaner, greener way of dealing with food waste. Having an EcoWaste Digester helps attract corporate tenants who want to do business in a building where efforts are being made to be more environmentally friendly. And, with no need to store bags or bins full of food waste, foul odors and pests are eliminated.</p><p>A building with an EcoWaste Digester is a building well on its way to achieving sustainability goals.</p>
