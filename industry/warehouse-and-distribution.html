description: <p>With an extreme high dependency, over 90% on a single energy source – fossil oil, distribution businesses need initiatives to drive efficient use of this increasingly expensive resource.</p><p>As businesses strive to deliver the optimum sustainable distribution model, they are primarily concerned with the transportation/hauling of goods between vendors and purchasers with the lowest possible environmental impact. Whilst the focus includes the whole distribution process from storage, order processing and picking, packaging, improved vehicle loadings, delivery and taking back packaging – rising energy and fuel costs can sometimes be seen to be out of their control.</p><p>Whether you’re looking to improve the costs of operating 24×7 refrigeration equipment, or seeking to reduce the fuel bills of your refrigerated transport, ORCA EcoWaste Digester has a solution for you.</p><p>To see how an Energy or Fuel Optimization plan can deliver guaranteed savings for your business, call us.</p>
