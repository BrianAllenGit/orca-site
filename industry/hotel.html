subheader: Hotel Waste Management Solution
description: <p>There’s a reason why well-known hotels such as the Waldorf Astoria in New York and the Intercontinental in Toronto have installed the ORCA in their kitchens&#58; they’ve eliminated the cost of having food waste hauled away by truck, and reduced the amount of time employees spend carting food waste around the building to put in bins or bags awaiting collection. This has taken a lot of pressure off employees, who now simply separate food waste at the source and feed it to the ORCA.</p><p>The time and effort expended to haul bags of food waste between floors in a hotel is not insignificant. Employees risk injury and waste time on this task. Using ORCA technology is great for morale, as employees feel happy they are helping to make a positive contribution to the environment.</p><p>By installing an ORCA at your hotel, you can not only save money, but also improve your property’s green solutions—something your guests will see as an asset. Having an ORCA on the premises could even qualify your hotel for a Trip Advisor Green Leaders designation. This program showcases a variety of eco-friendly hotels that are committed to green practices such as recycling, and many environmentally conscious travellers seek them out specifically.</p><p>The ORCA can help your hotel comply with organic waste disposal regulation, if applicable, or the building’s waste diversion goals. And finally, the ORCA helps eliminate odors and pests that come with accumulated food waste on the premises.</p>
