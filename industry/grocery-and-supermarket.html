subheader: Grocery and Supermarket Waste Management Solution
description:  <p>Housing such a large volume of food products, including produce, seafood, meat, bakery and hot food service on site, supermarkets can really benefit from ORCA EcoWaste Digester food waste disposal technology.</p> <p>Rather than paying to have all this food waste hauled away to landfill, supermarkets can simply divert the waste into the ORCA EcoWaste Digester. Employees at the store feed the ORCA EcoWaste Digester regularly, and the harmless effluent flows into the municipal sewage system.</p> <p>As part of the ORCA EcoWaste Digester solution, we provide a food waste transportation system to collect waste in a clean and efficient manner.</p><p>The ORCA EcoWaste Digester helps keep the store clean, with fewer foul odors and pests associated with stored food waste.</p> <p>Using an ORCA EcoWaste Digester also improves security, reducing the number of trucks coming and going. Space on the loading docks is then freed up for trucks delivering revenue-generating inventory.</p> <p>Just as important, the ORCA EcoWaste Digester can help reduce your storeâ€™s environmental impact score, and demonstrate to the public that you are a responsible company.</p>
