subheader: Amusement Park Management Solution 
description: Half the fun of going to an amusement park is trying the food at various food stands. With the potential to generate an enormous amount of food waste, amusement parks can benefit from having ORCA technology installed on the premises. The ORCA eliminates the need for staff to haul food waste to a loading dock. It “eats” food waste on site, which means you don’t have to pay for trucks to take the waste to landfill. The resulting cost savings can be significant. Using an ORCA is the ultimate environmentally friendly solution. Visitors to your facility and the local community will all appreciate your efforts at environmental responsibility and carbon footprint reduction. As well, having an ORCA on site can help eliminate foul odors and pests associated with stored food waste.
