description:  <p>Large restaurants can cut the cost of food waste disposal by installing ORCA technologyonsite in the kitchen.</p><p> Rather than keeping food waste in unsanitary garbage bins and garbage bags while it sits waiting to be collected and hauled away by truck, staff simply drop food waste into the ORCA, and that’s it—the ORCA digests the waste within 24 hours and turns it into earth-friendly water that flows into the municipal sewage system.</p><p> The ORCA can be installed right in your kitchen in a location convenient to your staff.</p><p> Being more sanitary, the ORCA can help eliminate foul odors and pests associated with food waste disposal—thereby helping your restaurant retain its good standing with the municipal health department.</p>
