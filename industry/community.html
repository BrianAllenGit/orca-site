subheader: Community or Not for Profit Solution
description: With Community or Not for Profit organisations every cent counts. That’s why reducing unnecessary spending on energy and fuel is paramount. Environment and Community often don’t mix. Too often, the implementation of environmental initiatives, such as solar, can be out of reach for many organisations when they can barely maintain their operational costs and are reliant on the contributions of others. But it doesn’t have to be that way. With the guaranteed savings you make on a Forum Enviro Energy Optimisation Plan, you fund access to the latest in energy saving technology through savings on your electricity bill. And if you have a fleet of vehicles, reduced fuel consumption can be achieved via a Forum Enviro Fuel Optimisation Plan. However you look at it, its better for the community. Less cost. Less environmental impact. See what we can do for your organisation. Call us.
